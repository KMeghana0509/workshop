        <b>What is the difference between div and span?</b>
        <p>The main difference between div and span elements in HTML lies in their default display properties and their
            typical use cases:</p>
        <p>
            div: This is a block-level element. By default, it takes up the full width available and starts on a new
            line. Block-level elements are generally used to structure larger sections of a page, such as containers for
            layout or grouping content.

        </p>
        <p>
            span: This is an inline element. It only takes up as much width as necessary and does not start on a new
            line. Inline elements are typically used for styling or modifying a part of text within a line without
            affecting the layout of surrounding content.
        </p>
        Use Cases:
        div: Commonly used for grouping larger sections of content or creating layout containers. For example, you might
        use a div to create a section of a webpage or to group multiple elements together for styling or scripting.</p>
        <p>span: Typically used for styling or scripting within a block of text. For instance, you might use a span tag
            to change the color or style of a few words within a paragraph without affecting the layout of the paragraph
            itself.</p>

        <b>What are the semantic elements in html?</b>

        <p>
            Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way.
            They help to create a well-structured and meaningful web page, improving accessibility, SEO, and
            maintainability. Here are some common semantic elements and their purposes:
        </p>
        <p>
        <pre>
        header : Represents introductory content or a set of navigational links, typically found at the top of a page or section.

        nav : Defines a navigation section, usually containing links to other pages or sections of the website.
            
        main : Represents the dominant content of the body, excluding headers, footers, and sidebars. There should be only one main element per document.
            
        section : Defines a section of content, typically with a heading. It groups related content together.
            
        article : Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed independently, such as a blog post, news article, or forum post.
            
        aside : Contains content that is tangentially related to the content around it, such as sidebars, pull quotes, or advertisements.
            
        footer : Contains footer content for a section or the entire page, such as contact information, copyright notices, or links to related documents.
            
        figure : Used to encapsulate media (like images, illustrations, or videos) and its caption, which is specified with the figcaption element.
            
        figcaption: Provides a caption or description for the content inside a figure.
            
        time: Represents a specific period in time, such as a date or time, and allows for better machine readability.
            
        address: Provides contact information for the author or owner of a document or section.
            
        details: Allows the user to view or hide additional information, typically shown or hidden with a toggle.
            
        summary: Provides a summary or heading for the content inside a details element.
            
        mark: Highlights parts of text that have relevance or importance, often used to emphasize a keyword or phrase.
            
        label: Defines a label for an input element, improving form accessibility by associating labels with form controls.
            
        Using semantic elements helps both browsers and assistive technologies understand the structure and content of a web page better, leading to improved user experience and accessibility.

        <b>What is the difference between href attribute and src attribute?</b>
        <p>
        <pre>
The `href` and `src` attributes are used in HTML to link resources, but they serve different purposes:

href: Specifies the URL of a resource to link to. It is used with elements like a, link, and base. It is
primarily for creating hyperlinks to other pages or resources.

src: Specifies the URL of a resource to embed or include. It is used with elements like img, script, and
iframe. It is primarily for embedding resources such as images, scripts, or iframes into the current
document.

        <b>What is difference between xml and html?</b>
        <p>
        <pre>
XML (Extensible Markup Language) and HTML (HyperText Markup Language) are both markup languages, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

Purpose
HTML: Designed for creating and displaying web pages. It defines the structure and layout of web content.
XML: Designed for storing and transporting structured data. It focuses on data representation and allows for the creation of custom tags.
Tag Flexibility
HTML: Uses predefined tags (like p, div, a, etc.) that are standardized and understood by web browsers.
XML: Allows users to define their own tags and structure. It is not predefined and is customizable based on the needs of the application.
Structure
HTML: Looser syntax rules. For example, it is not required for all tags to be closed, and the document can be rendered even if some tags are missing or incorrect.
XML: Strict syntax rules. All tags must be properly nested and closed. XML documents must be well-formed to be parsed correctly.
Case Sensitivity
HTML: Tags are not case-sensitive. title is equivalent to TITLE.
XML: Tags are case-sensitive. Tag and tag would be considered different.
Document Validation
HTML: Validation is based on a predefined DTD or schema, but browsers often handle invalid HTML gracefully.
XML: Validation can be enforced using a DTD (Document Type Definition) or XML Schema. XML documents must adhere to these definitions to be considered valid.
Usage
HTML: Primarily used for displaying content on web pages.
XML: Used for data interchange between systems and for storing hierarchical data in a text format.

        <b>What are list tags and how many are they?</b>
        <p>
        <pre>
HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists.

Unordered HTML List:
An unordered list starts with the ul tag. Each list item starts with the li tag.

The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default.

Ordered HTML List:
An ordered list starts with the ol tag. Each list item starts with the li tag.

The list items will be marked with numbers by default.

Description list:
A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.
The dl tag defines the description list, the dt tag defines the term (name), and the dd tag describes each term:
